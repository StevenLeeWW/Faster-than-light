# Faster than light communication?

Written on 02.08.2021

When you see the title, you probably think that this is not gonna work, because you learned that the ultimate speed limit of the universe is the speed of light (actually every 
massless object will travel in this speed in the vaccuum). Massive object moving faster than light is impossible as shown in Einstein's special relativity. More importantly, 
moving faster than light or sending information faster than light can reach the receiver will violate the sacred law of causality. So, superluminal communication is never gonna 
work and it is just a waste of time to even think about it.

However, maybe you will change your mind after reading this to the end.

Before I start to talk about the experiment setup that seems possible to let us communicate faster than light (FTL), I think we first need to understand the famous delayed choice quantum
eraser ([DCQE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraser)) experiment, because the FTL-communication setup is based on the setup and understanding of the DCQE experiment. 
For people who is unfamiliar with the DCQE experiment, I recommend you to watch the videos from [PBS Spacetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ORLN_KwAgs) and from [The Science Asylum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyN27R7UDnI) 
first.

## Understanding the DCQE experiment.

In the internet, people like to mystify the DCQE experiment by invoking retrocausality (i.e. future event can affect past event) in their explanation of the experiment's results. 
Actually, there are other explanations that do not invoke retrocausality (See for example the blog [Deflating Delayed Choice Quantum Erasure](https://algassert.com/quantum/2016/01/07/Delayed-Choice-Quantum-Erasure.html) and [A Classical Delayed Choice Experiment](https://algassert.com/post/1720) and the paper [Taming the DCQE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07884)).
